The owner to provide favicon for website
hide other fronted routes before showing them 

when returning list of products, return the slug field too (to_dict() method)

✅anonymous adding items to cart

remove console.log statements
remove cartSummary variable from our store(state.ts)
if we get url for cartSummary, use that to get the totalItemsInCart value
✅pagination and filtering products doesn't work together

i need route to get the cartSummary

also, delivery fee, i'm thinking we should have a route that sets the fee
url ya all user reviews, user profile

updateCartSummary after updating cart in cart.vue (updateCartItemsShown())
Remove pagination from url returning categories, sub_cats, brands, reviews

csrf_exempt wishlist routes
check the error when login failed


problem on getting cart items. i need the summary too
on the cartSummary object, eg when they click on "Dar es Sal", I'll call that url, and you'll update the cartSummary. I'm avoiding doing calculations on the frontend. risky

BACKEND
✅Allow categories to be found using the name and not int IDs (eg laptops instead of 4)
IMPORTANT: validation of admin actions. eg adding product (they shouldn't leave any field empty)
return cart summary from backend. 
✅can user write multiple reviews for the same product. NOP
how do we handle user updating items in cart
✅add view for user to delete a review

GET /categories/ should accept category name instead of id
Are these name attributes stored anywhere in the backend.
    path('users/orders/', views.list_orders_placed_by_user_with_user_id, name='list-user-orders'),
or can i just use any 'name' as long as its unique

LATER: When returning items in cart, could you return the total number as well
LATER: allow product to have multiple images in database.
✅ write route to return reviews written by a specific user. also return id of the reviewed product
✅ Change time format when returning list of orders(return date and time)
CHECK FUNCTION TO UPDATE USER (i get 403 error code). tried adding csrf exempt.still not working
LATER: Reset/user password logic
LATER: during sign up. get the first and last name as one field. not separate
LATER: updating user info. When they change email ( we need to send verification link)

login/logout/sign up -> return status codes. + the json 
add method to update cart items. eg when user selects new quantity in cart page
✅ remove/add certain fields to shipping address
do we need a wishlist table for users
(maybe not. users shouldn't cancel orders once created) create route for user to cancel active orders. To be done after we create user profile
user writing review (allow user to also enter a "title(summary of review)" among the other fields)
✅ if review created, don't return that json that you're returning rn
✅ also if address created, do you need to send back that address. maybe just a status code
can user create mutliple reviews for same product
✅ format date for when review created (dd-mm-yy)
return null for absence (eg when user cart is empty)

✅when post/delete/put request successfull, don't return the json response
✅with all that info that you're retrning now. just return sth like {"success" : True} (check view for when user creates a review successfully, i've added that)
✅We don't want to 'expose' that much info on the client
✅ When creating an order, 500 error thrown. check that out

✅I shouldn't place an order if i don't have items in cart. currently, if i do that, the order is placed. Amount=0. The exceptions dont work
✅Backend Error pages. eg when user tries to access a route that is prohibited. eg /media/images
Set debug=False on prod and set ALLOWED_HOSTS
✅IMPORTANT: There's multiple things that still need to be done on backend. Security wise. eg only showing user profile to the right user
✅return loginrequired for some routes. We'll discuss which ones
csrf
✅remove userID from urls. Get it using req.user.id
✅remove print statements
✅show_logged_in_user_id should only return true if user auth, otherwise false. not the user id
✅IMPORTANT: Check that right user only can access their data

ADMIN ONLY ACTIONS:
restrict certain urls to the admins only . eg
put/del/post categories,
get/put/del orders etc

FRONTEND
Only call functions after everything has loaded/been mounted
Add correct type interfaces for variables. remove any

Change site metatags
✅Form validation
Change src link of images in categories nav. it's static
✅After user has logged in, redirect them to prev url
✅Check: number of items in cart is not reactive (the value in the cart icon doens't change until a full page reload happens)
✅  remove user_id variable in pages
✅Create custom 404 page
✅ the protected routes can't be accessed from the browser
Allow user to delete address. To be done once we create their profile
